The issue is with the indentation of the `- name: Lint with flake8` line. It should be aligned with the `- name: Install dependencies` line. Here is the corrected YAML:

name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pytest
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest

    - name: Mock Deployment
      run: |
        echo "Deploying application..."

This workflow will be triggered every time you push to the main branch. It will setup Python, install dependencies, lint your code using flake8, run tests using pytest, and finally, it will print "Deploying application..." to simulate a deployment step.
